# Password Manager in Python
I created a simple user data management application written in Python. The program allows for:
  Adding new users and their passwords,
  Sorting stored data by username,
  Displaying all saved usernames and passwords,
  Deleting stored data.

The application stores data in text files, making it easy to modify and manage information.
The program runs in a loop with an interactive menu, offering various options and allowing the user to easily test each functionality. Thanks to the intuitive interface, the application is simple and convenient to use.
